a picture of bruce lee appeared in my apartment lobby during a stressful exam season.

each morning rush comes with his quiet reminder.

i wonder if it was placed by a thoughtful stranger.

or rather, i wonder if Bruce Lee placed the strangers around me.

i can't help but stare when i walk past him.

Bruce Lee can't help but stare as he pushes me past him.

"Go for it!", his determined eyes tell me.

"You can do it!", i say to myself in response.

did he appear to push me along?

can i attribute a fraction of my midterm success to his support?
